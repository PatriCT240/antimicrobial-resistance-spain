# Antimicrobial Resistance in Spain (2000–2018)
**Data Analysis Project by Patrícia C. Torrell**

This project analyzes 18 years of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data in Spain using EARS‑Net surveillance records.  
It applies industry‑standard analytics, statistical modeling, and clear scientific communication to uncover trends that matter for public health and clinical decision‑making.

---

## Key Insights (Executive Summary)
- AMR is rising in Spain, especially in **betalactam antibiotics**.  
- **Acinetobacter spp.** shows the highest and most variable resistance.  
- Children aged **0–4** display unique resistance patterns.  
- **Fluoroquinolones** consistently show the highest resistance across bacteria.  
- Predictive models (ARIMA + classification tree) indicate **continued upward trends**.

## Project Highlights

### Age & Gender Analysis
- Boxplots, ANOVA, PCA, correlations  
- Clear differences across age groups  
- Small but consistent gender effects  

### Antibiotic Resistance Profiles
- Median resistance tables  
- Stacked barplots for RAM > 10%  
- Betalactam vs non‑betalactam trends  

### Predictive Modeling
- **ARIMA forecasting** for resistance evolution  
- **Classification tree** for antibiotic decision support
