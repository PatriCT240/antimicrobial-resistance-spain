

Welcome to the project website for the analysis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Spain using EARS‑Net surveillance data from 2000 to 2018.  
This site summarizes the key findings, methodology, and insights from the full analytical report.

## Executive Summary

- AMR is rising in Spain, especially in **betalactam antibiotics**.  
- **Acinetobacter spp.** shows the highest and most variable resistance.  
- Children aged **0–4** display unique resistance patterns.  
- **Fluoroquinolones** consistently show the highest resistance across bacteria.  
- Predictive models indicate **continued upward trends** in resistance.

## Project Overview

This project includes:

- Age‑specific and gender‑specific resistance analysis  
- Bacteria–antibiotic resistance profiling  
- Temporal evolution of resistance (2000–2018)  
- Predictive modeling (ARIMA + classification tree)  
- Visualizations, tables, and reproducible R code
